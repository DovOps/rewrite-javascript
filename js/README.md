# TypeScript Compiler Wrapper

Until the Gradle build does it automatically, changes to the JS sub-project need to be synced to the parent project.

The first time you check out the project, or when you change `package.json`, run (all commands from the `js` dir):
```shell
nvm use && yarn install
```

When you make changes here, run:
```shell
nvm use && yarn update
```

## Structure

- `src/`
  - `codegen/` is for scripts that generate Java and TypeScript code during the build process
    - `generatedLicenseHeader.txt` is inserted at the top of every generated Java/TS file
  - `runtime/` is for TypeScript code that runs on the embedded V8 inside the JVM for parsing and type-checking
  - `generated/` is for TypeScript code generated by `codegen`, which can be referenced by
  - `Paths.ts` exports known resolved absolute paths to avoid path-building errors when refactoring
